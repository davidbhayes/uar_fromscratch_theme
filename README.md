# FromScratch Theme
This theme is not fancy. What it does is systematically move through the steps I take when building a WordPress theme from scratch.

I didn't tag releases to videos or anything. But I think the commit messages are clear enough that you should be able to get most of the direction you need from them. https://github.com/davidbhayes/uar_fromscratch_theme/commits/master
